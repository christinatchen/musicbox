# musicbox
Final project for CS320: Tangible User Interfaces

Written in Arduino IDE, this repository contains two different files. One, musicBoxReact, reads in audio input from a Sparkfun Spectrum Shield, breaks it into separate frequencies, and makes lights and a vibration motor react along to the song.

The other, playMusic, controls reading .wav files from an SD Card module, and handles the button inputs to change songs as well as control the volume.
